Old Macintosh systems can use some Apple-specific display modes or timings that don't quite line up with what the RetroTink expects. They can also use different refresh rates that require tweaks to get things looking their best.

This is a package of RetroTink profiles and custom modes that make it easier to use vintage Macintosh systems with the RetroTink 4K. Much of this is an early work in progress based on a couple of vintage systems I own.

## Included Profiles

### Quadra 605

Aimed at early machines that include an Apple DB-15 video port and a VGA adapter. Should work with most 68K machines, and even early PowerPC machines. Has only been tested with System 7 and MacOS 8.1.

Tuned for 640x480 @ 67Hz, 832x624 @ 75Hz and 1024x768 @ 75Hz.

### PowerMac Quicksilver G4

Aimed at later PowerMacs that have VGA video cards. Includes an array of tuned display modes out of the box. It is heavily recommended to use SwitchRes when using the RetroTink 4K like this. MacOS doesn't know which refresh rates to recommend, and the RetroTink doesn't adjust to different refresh rates well.

#### Apple Specific Modes:
- Macintosh 832x624
- Macintosh 1152x860 (Work in Progress)

#### Unusual Apple Timings (GeForce 2MX on MacOS 9):
