There is also a copy of `input_database.txt` included based on the 1.6.9 firmware that you can copy over to the SD card to replace the one that's there. This is only recommended if you have not modified the file.

## Copy Profiles

Simply copy the `profile/Apple PC` folder to the `profile` folder on the RetroTink 4K SD Card. If you have modified these profiles from an earlier version of these profiles, you can copy just the new ones.
